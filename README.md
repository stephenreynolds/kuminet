# Setup

Follow the instructions in the [Screeps Typescript Starter readme](https://github.com/screepers/screeps-typescript-starter) to download the necessary files. You will need to create your own screeps.json file from the sample given there.

# Compiling and Deploying

To just build, run `npm run build`. To build and deploy on save, run `npm run watch-DESTINATION`.
